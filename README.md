# My Attempt at advent of code 2021

Happy holidays! Hopefully I finish all of them this year.

Try to attempt it yourself before you look at my solutions!

A great break from doing leetcode type questions.

## How to run

1. Clone this repo
2. Install python 3
3. Run each solution with `python3 index.py`
